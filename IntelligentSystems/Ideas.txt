Just some possible ideas
Strategy:
Loopup function with alpha beta pruning?
Or Adaptive? (Need a lot of statistics for this)
	If we choose adaptive
		Which different bots should we use?

Heuristics function:
Variables:
	Number of enemy ships
	Number of enemy planets and/or regeneration rate?
	Our own number of ships
	Our own regeneration rate/number of planets?

Would be nice to have:
Program which is able to test different bots multiple times and obtain statistics of who wins (probably in python)

Possible uses for the program:
For final assignment, we have results
Make adaptive strategy, based on results
Test statistics of different heuristic functions, so we can see which performs better
